# KnightPathFinder

Created a program to generate the path to travel a knight to an end position from its starting position on a chess board.

Here are some example paths:

```ruby
kpf.find_path([7, 6]) # => [[0, 0], [1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6], [5, 5], [7, 6]]
kpf.find_path([6, 2]) # => [[0, 0], [1, 2], [2, 0], [4, 1], [6, 2]]
```
